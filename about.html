          <h1>Thanks for visiting my site</h1>
          <p>I am a passionate developer who loves coding,programming languages. I always like to learn new things.I try to learn as many languages as i possibly can
          </p>

          <p>With About a Year of development experience in a FullStack-WebDevelopment I realized that the typical product creation
            process between clients and developers was flawed. All too often developers rarely communicate to clients throughout
            the development stage, resulting in a final product that fails to reach the goal sought by the customer and end
            user.
